Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I was provided with starter code that defined the game environment and supporting structures for training an intelligent agent. This included the TreasureMaze.py file, which represents the maze environment and handles state observations, valid actions, rewards, and win/lose conditions, as well as the GameExperience.py file, which manages experience replay and stores episode data. I was also given a partially completed Jupyter Notebook (TreasureHuntGame.ipynb) that included the model creation structure and placeholders for the Q-training algorithm.My primary contribution was implementing the deep Q-learning training logic inside the qtrain() function. I wrote the code that controls the training loop, including episode execution, epsilon-greedy action selection, experience replay, neural network training using minibatches, target network updates, and win-rate tracking. I also integrated exploration–exploitation behavior, early stopping conditions, and performance monitoring to ensure the pirate agent could successfully learn to navigate the maze and reach the treasure. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Throughout this course, I learned that computer science is not just about writing code, but about designing systems that can solve complex problems efficiently, adapt to new situations, and support human decision-making. In this project, concepts such as algorithms, data structures, optimization, and artificial intelligence came together to create an intelligent agent capable of learning from experience. This reflects the broader role of computer scientists: they analyze problems, model real-world systems, and develop computational solutions that can scale and improve over time.Computer scientists matter because the systems they design directly influence how society functions. Computer scientists change the way that the world works just like anyone else in an engineer or scientist field does, solving problems by creating and developing techniques to make the world a better place or more advanced in some way. Without computer scientists our world would be at a standstill and it is essential to innovation at this time. In the context of artificial intelligence, computer scientists are responsible not only for building intelligent systems but also for ensuring they are reliable, interpretable, and ethically applied. The work done in this course demonstrates how foundational computer science principles can be applied to create intelligent, adaptive systems that solve real-world problems and shape the future of technology.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I think every problem starts with looking at what we are trying to solve for. As a computer scientist you are dealing with a lot of complex issues that often don't even have a correct answer. Most of the time you are just trying to weigh the pros and cons to get the most optomized system and accepting the tradeoffs. I learned that having a wholistic view of an issue will help dramatically in understanding the context of the problem. Once the problem has been fully defined that is where we can come in and apply our knowledge of the algorithms, data structures, and models we have learned to best fix the problem at hand. It is also our job as computer scientists to analyze any ethical concerns in development and to fully understand the system we put into play. It is our responsibility to consider the safety, ethical, and performance concerns of everything we do. Once we identify the problem, understand what it is solving, and put a system in place to solve it, the last step is analysis. The world of computer science and technology as a whole is never ending, we can constantly improve old techniques and create new ones. After implementing a solution, the process continues with testing, evaluation, and iteration. Results are analyzed, assumptions are refined, and improvements are made based on observed behavior. This iterative, analytical approach ensures that solutions are not only functional, but robust, scalable, and aligned with real-world requirements.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to both the end user and the organization that deploys the technology. To the end user, my primary responsibility is to ensure that systems are safe, reliable, and transparent. This means designing software that behaves as expected, minimizes harm, and does not mislead users or place them at unnecessary risk. In the context of artificial intelligence, it also involves being mindful of bias, unintended consequences, and over-reliance on automated systems. Users should be able to trust that the technology respects their well-being, privacy, and autonomy.To the organization, my ethical responsibility is to act with honesty, professionalism, and accountability. This includes writing maintainable and well-documented code, accurately representing system capabilities and limitations, and considering long-term impacts rather than short-term gains. Computer scientists must balance innovation with responsibility by ensuring that systems align with organizational goals while also complying with legal, ethical, and societal standards. Ultimately, it is our job to make sure both the organization and the user are protected and more importantly aware via transparency of any risks or biased involved in creating models or systems.
